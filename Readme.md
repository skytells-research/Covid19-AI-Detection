## Abstract
COVID-19 has widely spread all over the world since the first case was detected at the end of 2019.
Early diagnosis of the disease is important for treatment and the isolation of the patients to prevent the virus spread.

The DeepBrain model, was developed to extract visual features from 4,356 computed tomography (CT) exams from 3,322 patients for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the robustness of the model.
The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90 percent and 96 percent, respectively.

## Background
The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) presents several unique features. While the diagnosis is confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images with a pattern that is only moderately characteristic for the human eye [Ng, 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryct.2020200034). COVID-19â€™s rate of transmission depends on our capacity to reliably identify infected patients with a low rate of false negatives. In addition, a low rate of false positives is required to avoid further increasing the burden on the healthcare system by unnecessarily exposing patients to quarantine if that is not required. Along with proper infection control, it is evident that timely detection of the disease would enable the implementation of all the supportive care required by patients affected by COVID-19.

In late January, a Chinese team published a paper detailing the clinical and paraclinical features of COVID-19. They reported that patients present abnormalities in chest CT images with most having bilateral involvement [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext). Bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation constitute the typical findings in chest CT images of intensive care unit (ICU) patients on admission [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext). In comparison, non-ICU patients show bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation in their chest CT images [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext). In these patients, later chest CT images display bilateral ground-glass opacity with resolved consolidation [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext).

COVID is possibly better diagnosed using radiological imaging [Fang, 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200432) and [Ai 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200642).

## Motivation

While PCR tests offer many advantages they are physical things that require shipping the test or the sample. X-ray machines can be plugged in to screen patients as long as they have electricity.
Imagine a future where we run out of tests and then the majority of radiologists get sick. AI tools can help general practitioners to triage and treat patients.
Companies are developing AI tools and deploying them at hospitals [Wired 2020](https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hospitals-deploy-ai-help-diagnose-covid-19/). We should have an open database to develop free tools that will also provide assistance.

## Goal

Our goal is to use these images to develop AI based approaches to predict and understand the infection.


## Test Results
When passing an X-Ray image to the model, it analyzes the image deeply and respond with classification results

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Xcode 10.3+
- iOS 12.0+
- Swift 4.2
- DeepBrain CoreML Model

### Model

The DeepBrain model was trained with more than 1,300 images in high resolution

#### PRECISION RECALL
----------------------------------
Class              Precision(%)   Recall(%)      
BacterialPneumonia 94.74          85.71          
Covid19            98.57          100.00         
Normal             100.00         97.22          
ViralPneumonia     92.31          97.30         

#### Type

Image Classifier

##### Classifiers
- `XRayClassifier`
    - Quick detection - low accuracy of detection ratio
- `DeepClassifier`
    - Takes some time for detection - high accuracy of detection ratio

##### Detection Ability
The DeepBrain model was trained to detect the following:

- COVID-19
- Bacterial Pneumonia
- Viral Pneumonia

The model responds with `Normal` incase of none of above was detected during the classification.

#### Description

The model trained to detect COVID-19 from X-Ray & CT Images.

### Languages
The app was manually translated to
* ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English (US)
